# Process Scheduling Algorithm Simulator

This repository contains a web-based simulator that implements and visualizes the most common process scheduling algorithms in operating systems:

- FIFO (First-In, First-Out)
- Round Robin
- SJF (Shortest Job First)

## Features

- Interactive web interface for experimenting with process scheduling algorithms
- Customizable parameters for each algorithm (e.g., time quantum for Round Robin)
- Visualization of process execution and waiting times
- Comparative analysis of algorithm performance

## Getting Started

To run the simulator locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/Areshkew/dispatch_algorithms.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```
   cd dispatch_algorithms
   ```

3. Open the `index.html` file in your web browser.

## Usage

1. Select the desired scheduling algorithm from the radio options.
2. Adjust the algorithm processes.
3. Click the "Solve" button to run the visualization.
5. View the results, including the chart and wating time and system time.
